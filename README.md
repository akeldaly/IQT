# Alternative Learning Paradigms for Image Quality Transfer

This respiratory provides two implementations for image quality transfer (IQT) using (1) deep dictionary learning (IQT-DDL), and (2) sparse representation using dictionary learning (IQT-SRep).

This respiratory provides codes used in the paper 
Ahmed Karam Eldaly, Matteo Figini, and Daniel C. Alexander ''Alternative Learning Paradigms for Image Quality Transfer'', submitted to Imaging Neuroscience 2024.
